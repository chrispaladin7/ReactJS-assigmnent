Americans generally believe that their Thanksgiving is modeled on a 1621 harvest feast shared by the English colonists (Pilgrims) of Plymouth and the Wampanoag people. The American holiday is particularly rich in legend and symbolism, and the traditional fare of the Thanksgiving meal typically includes turkey, bread stuffing, potatoes, cranberries, and pumpkin pie. With respect to vehicular travel, the holiday is often the busiest of the year, as family members gather with one another. Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on Thursday, November 25, 2021.

Get Friday off as well and it\u2019s the rare four-day weekend; go back to work and it\u2019s just a hassle for travel.But, as it turns out, the earliest Thanksgivings in what\u2019s now the United States had very different timing. Crucially, they weren\u2019t just a once-a-year special event.The earliest Thanksgivings in the [American] colonies in the 17th century were called for the purpose of giving thanks for a specific blessing, says Melanie Kirkpatrick, author of Thanksgiving: The Holiday at the Heart of the American Experience and Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute. Much-needed good weather or a victory in a skirmish with Native Americans \u2014 with whom, contrary to the more mythical Thanksgiving story, peace was the exception to the rule \u2014 might earn a mention from a colony\u2019s governor, and a special day would be set aside, but when that day fell would obviously depend on what had happened. For example, leaders of the colony of Plymouth, Mass., called for a day of Thanksgiving in 1623 at the end of a severe drought when they felt like their prayers for rain had been answered.","date":"11/22/2021","imgUrl":"happy-thanksgiving-written-on-a-table-surrounded-by-plates-of-food.webp","summary":"For Americans, the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday \u2014 the fourth Thursday in November \u2014 can be a blessing or a curse."},{"id":"3","title":"Coronavirus: The agonising Thanksgiving dilemma facing millions of Americans","body":"With over a million new Covid-19 cases nationwide in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University, public health officials are cautioning people not to gather in large groups this holiday season.Next week\'s Thanksgiving weekend poses a particular concern.
